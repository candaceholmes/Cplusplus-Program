# Cplusplus-Program

# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
This project calculated the way that investments would grow based on various factors, such as initial investment, monthly contribution, and percentage of interest. Rather than having to enter all of that information into your own formula and calculator, this project just requires the initial information and will do the calculations for you.

# What did you do particularly well?
I come from a business background, so I have a good understanding of the kind of math and was able to translate it into code effeciently and clearly. I think my naming conventions and math made a lot of sense, were easy to use, and would be easy for another coder to read and understand. 

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
I didn't use inline comments, which are a way I could have been more clear for any future coders coming in to make any changes or improvements to the code. These changes would make my code more efficient for any future use. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
Formatting the output of this code was a bit challenging for me. I would like to learn more ways to make the output look more pleasing or an easier way to format the output. I went back through our ZyBooks and also just experimented a lot to get the output looking as aesthetically pleasing and legible as I could. I have referenced our Zybooks a lot, so I want to find an outside resource similar, as I solidify my coding skills, to reference. 

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
Using code to calculate math, specifically business related math, is very useful and applicable to many jobs, industries, and future classes. I am currently in a Calculus class, and I used coding a bit to help minimize some of the more tedious work. I can see this being the case in the future as I become a more adept programmer and as I get into more advanced coursework or work in my career. 

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I tried to do everything as clearly and simply as possible, so that any future programmers would be able to understand what I was doing. I used easy to read for loops, and straight-forward naming conventions. However, as I stated before, I should have used more inline commments.
